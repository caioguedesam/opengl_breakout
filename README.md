# OpenGL Breakout
This is an implementation of the classic Atari 2600 hit Breakout, using C++ and OpenGL. This project was made as an assignment for the Computer Graphics course at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG).

This project uses legacy OpenGL, and may or may not be ported to modern OpenGL in the future.
